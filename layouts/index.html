  <p>
    My name is <strong>Mario Sanchez Carrion</strong>. I work as a product manager for a large power tools company. Here's my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/mariobox">LinkedIn</a> profile. 
  </p>
  <p>
    While I'm not at work I can usually be found coding, investing, reading non-fiction, watching soccer or traveling. 
  </p>
<h3>Coding</h3> 
  <p>
    My coding journey has taken me to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, React and NodeJS, <a href="/skills/">among other things</a>, as well as the fundamentals of computer science, the Internet and algorithmic thinking. I am mostly self taught.
  </p>
  <p>
    For those beginning to learn I highly recommend the <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science"> CS50 Introduction to Computer Science</a> course from Harvard, which you can now take online for free at <a href="https://edx.org">edX</a>. 
  </p>

    These are some projects I've completed:

<h3>Investing</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Personal finance and investing</strong> is another one of my big areas of interest. I try to follow the value investing route, as advocated by Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett. I like to focus on mid-to-large cap dividend-paying companies with great brands, and try to buy at market dips. I also like to invest in real estate. I'm sure there are more exciting ways to invest, but the conservative approach works for me and matches my personality and risk profile. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Regarding investment books, I usually recommend those that focus on the fundamentals and mental models, rather than tactics and fads. A few good ones are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XB487HP/">The Millionnaire Next Door</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1612680194">Rich Dad Poor Dad</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FC12C8/">The Intelligent Investor</a>, <a href="https://darrenhardy.com/the-compound-effect-resources">The Compound Effect</a> and Ray Dalio's <a href="https://www.principles.com/">Principles</a>. I also recommend Naval Ravikant's epic post <a href="https://nav.al/rich">How To Get Rich</a> (available also in audio format via the same link).
</p>
<h3>Reading</h3>
  <p>
    I somtimes post highlights of books that I read. You can find them <a href="/reading">here</a>. These notes are just passages that resonated with me, not a book summary or review.
  </p>
<h3>Travel</h3>
  <p>
    I've had the opportunity to travel to many places around the world either for work or for pleasure. These are some <a href="/snapshots">pictures</a>. You can find more at my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mariobox/albums">Flickr</a> page.
