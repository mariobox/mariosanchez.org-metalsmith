    My name is Mario Sanchez Carrion. I'm a junior <a href="/skills">web developer and programmer</a> based in Miami. This is a personal site I put together to practice and keep track of what I learn. I've completed the <strong>Front End Web Development</strong> and <strong>Basic JavaScript</strong> tracks at <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/mariosanchezcarrion">Treehouse</a>, and learned to build back end applications with <strong>Python and SQL</strong> in <a href="img/CS50.png">CS50x</a> (Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science extension course). I am currently enrolled in <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science">Codecademy's Data Science</a> carreer path.
