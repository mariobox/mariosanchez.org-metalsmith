	  My name is Mario Sanchez Carrion. I'm a product development manager working for a Fortune 500 consumer goods company, and also a hobbyist web developer and programmer. This is my personal web development site, where I practice what I <a href="/skills">learn</a> and post occasional <a href="/now">updates</a>, as well as <a href="/snapshots">pictures</a> of the places I've been or the things I'm doing.
