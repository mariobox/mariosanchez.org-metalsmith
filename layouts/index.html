    My name is <strong>Mario Sanchez Carrion</strong> and this is my personal website. While I'm not at <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/mariobox">work</a> I spend most of my time learning how to code, and I use this website to document and practice what I learn.  
  </p>
  <h3>Coding</h3> 
  <p>
    For the last couple of years I've been pursuing coding and web development as a serious hobby. I've mostly worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, ReactJS and NodeJS, <a href="/skills/">among other things</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're just starting out, I recommend the <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science"> CS50 Introduction to Computer Science</a> course from Harvard, which you can now take online for free at <a href="https://edx.org">edX</a>. This course will help you start off your coding journey on the right foot by focusing on the the fundamentals. Programming will make more sense to you after taking this course than if you just start learning by jumping around random tutorials and videos online. 
  </p>  
  <p>
    These are some <a href="code/">practice projects</a> I've completed.
  </p>
  <p>
    For info on the tools I regularly use for web development go <a href="/stack">here</a>. If you are interested in knowing how this site is made go <a href="/site">here</a>. If you're up to it, you can even check out the site's <a href="https://github.com/mariobox/mariosanchez.org">source code</a>. In the spirit of sharing, please feel free to use any part of the code or style sheet (just add your own content).
  </p>

  <h3>Photo Gallery</h3>
  <p>
    I've had the opportunity to travel to many places around the world either for work or for pleasure. These are some <a href="/photos">pictures</a> of places I've been.
  <p>
    I created the photo gallery from scratch using JavaScript and CSS. The CSS declarations are included in the main style sheet. If you're interested you can read <a href="../myphotos/">how the gallery is made</a>.

  <h3>Contact</h3>
  <p>My presence on social media is almost non-existent. I deleted my Facebook profile some time ago because <strong>I don't trust that company</strong>. I still maintain a profile on Twitter that I use mostly as a news aggregator. My preferred way of communicating is still email.</p>
