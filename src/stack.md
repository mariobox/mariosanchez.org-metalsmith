These are the tools I'm currently using for web development:

- **Computer**: Toshiba Satellite C55. 4Gb of RAM. Intel Celeron N2830 dual core processor.  It's a little underpowered, but it was cheap (~$250) and does the trick for now. 
- **Operating System**: [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop). I also enabled a second partition to run Windows 10 just in case I needed (never, so far).
- **Static Site Generator**: [Metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io), a simple, pluggable static site generator made with JavaScript.
- **Responsive Framework**: Custom CSS: [minimal.css](/css/minimal.css).
- **Version Control**: [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/mariobox).
- **Text Editor**: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **Hosting**: Nginx virtual private server running on an Ubuntu 16.04 droplet at [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/b96aa4f9fdfd) (referral link).
- **Email Client**: [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/) with Enigmail (for encryption).
- **SSL/TLS** Certificate by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org), to serve this site through HTTPS.
