I like to develop minimalistic sites that are pleasant to the eye, load quickly and let the users find what they want, fast.  I use the minimum amount of code possible, starting with semantically correct, W3C-validated HTML.

Whenever possible, I design from scratch, making use of frameworks and other tools only when they add value to the project. I tend to avoid pre-made templates, which are usually bloated with features you don't need and are difficult to customize and maintain.

These are some of the tools and technologies I use for web development:

<i class="icon-html5-alt"></i> ** HTML5 **

DOM (Document Object Model), semantic tags, IDs and classes, tables, forms, audio/video embeds.

<i class="icon-css3-alt"></i> ** CSS3 **

Selectors (element, type, attribute), properties, pseudo-classes, media queries and responsive design, animation and transitions.

<i class="icon-javascript-alt"></i> ** JavaScript **

Variables, strings, booleans, arrays and objects, methods and functions, conditions, loops.

<i class="icon-jquery"></i> ** jQuery **

Selectors, effects, events, event handlers, DOM traversing.

<i class="icon-bootstrap"></i> ** Bootstrap **

The grid and all its components

<i class="icon-git"></i> ** Git **

Basic Git workflow tasks: git add, git commit, git push, git pull, branching, merging, working with Github.

<i class="icon-html"></i> ** Static Site Generators **

Layouts and templates, Markdown (for content), plug-ins. I have developed and deployed blogs and static sites with Jekyll, Hugo and Metalsmith.

<i class="icon-wordpress"></i> ** Wordpress **

Set up and deployment, themes, plug-ins. Not recommended for small sites and personal blogs (I like static site generators better, for speed and security).

<i class="icon-azure"></i> ** VPS ** (virtual private servers)

Server set up, virtual hosts, domain management, website deployment. I'm currently testing Digital Ocean VPSs.

<i class="icon-shell"></i> ** Command Line **

Basic Linux-style commands to navigate through directories, create and copy files, interact with git, and communicate with a VPS.

There is really no limit to what you can learn in web development. My aim is to add new skills and get better every single day through deliberate and focused practice.
