I like to develop minimalistic sites that are pleasant to the eye, load quickly and let the users find what they want, fast.  I use the minimum amount of code possible, starting with semantically correct, W3C-validated HTML.

Whenever possible, I design from scratch, making use of frameworks and other tools only when they add value to the project. I tend to avoid pre-made templates, which are usually bloated with features you don't need and are difficult to customize and maintain.

These are some of the tools and technologies I use for web development:

<i class="icon-html5-alt"></i> ** HTML5 **

DOM (Document Object Model), semantic tags, IDs and classes, tables, forms, audio/video embeds.

<i class="icon-css3-alt"></i> ** CSS3 **

Selectors (element, type, attribute), properties, pseudo-classes, media queries and responsive design, animation and transitions.

<i class="icon-javascript-alt"></i> ** JavaScript **

Variables, strings, booleans, arrays and objects, methods and functions, conditions, loops.

<i class="icon-jquery"></i> ** jQuery **

Selectors, effects, events, event handlers, DOM traversing.

<i class="icon-bootstrap"></i> ** Bootstrap **

The grid and all its components.

<i class="icon-git"></i> ** Git **

Basic Git workflow tasks: git add, git commit, git push, git pull, branching, merging, working with Github.

<i class="icon-html"></i> ** Static Site Generators **

Layouts and templates, Markdown (for content), plug-ins. I have developed and deployed blogs and static sites with Jekyll, Hugo and Metalsmith.

<i class="icon-wordpress"></i> ** Wordpress **

Set up and deployment, themes, plug-ins. Not recommended for small sites and personal blogs (I like static site generators better, for speed and security).

<i class="icon-azure"></i> ** VPS ** (virtual private servers)

Server set up, virtual hosts, domain management, website deployment. I'm currently testing Digital Ocean VPS.

<i class="icon-shell"></i> ** Command Line **

Basic Linux-style commands to navigate through directories, create and copy files, interact with Git, and communicate with a VPS.
