My current focus is on building this site and learning about the [decentralized web](https://dci.mit.edu/decentralizedweb). 

I'm currently trying out [Secure Scuttlebutt](https://scuttlebutt.nz), a peer-to-peer social network that uses no centralized point of contact and that you can read off-line (content resides in your local computer). I'm also experimenting with the [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com) and the [DAT](https://datproject.org) data sharing protocol. Aside from that, I am operating my own [VPS](..vps) (virtual private server) and learning more about its inner workings. 

I am also starting [CS50x Miami](http://theideacenter.co/cs50xmiami/) at the Idea Center on July 24. Should be fun!
