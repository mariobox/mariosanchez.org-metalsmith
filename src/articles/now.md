From Monday through Friday I work as a brand marketing manager for a large hardware manufacturer. On nights and weekends I spend most of the time teaching myself digital self-reliance and coding, and reading good non-fiction books.

My current focus is on learning about the decentralized web. 

The Internet has been [cornered by a few big players](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a15895746/bust-big-tech-silicon-valley/?src=nl&mag=esq&list=nl_enl_news&date=020818), none of which has your best interests at heart. Learning about, and promoting the use of tools that strive to bring the web back to its original, decentralized state is a way to fight back against those bad actors.

I'm currently trying out [Secure Scuttlebutt](https://scuttlebutt.nz), a peer-to-peer social network that uses no centralized point of contact and that you can read off-line (content resides in your local computer). I am also operating my own VPS (virtual private server) and learning more about its inner workings. As far as books is concerned, I am currently reading <a href="https://dci.mit.edu/decentralizedweb">The Decentralized Web. A report by the MIT Digital Currency Initiative and the Center for Civic Media</a>.
