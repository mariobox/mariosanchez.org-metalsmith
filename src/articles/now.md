On December 24 I concluded [CS50x Miami](http://theideacenter.co/cs50xmiami/) at the Idea Center. CS50 is the Introduction to Computer Science course from Harvard, now offered in different learning institutions around the country as CS50x (sort of like what TEDx does for TED). I'm glad I took this course since it focuses on the fundamentals, and gives you a very good foundation for further web development and programming learning.

I am now practicing the concepts learned in the class by applying them in different projects of interest, prior to progressing into ReactJS.
