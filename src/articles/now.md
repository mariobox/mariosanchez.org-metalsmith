My current focus is on building this site to practice what I learn. For the last few months I have been learning JavaScript and its different libraries and frameworks, like jQuery and ReactJS. I am also learning more about [Metalsmith](../metalswitch) (the static site generator that powers this site) and the inner workings of [Virtual Private Servers](..vps).

On July 24 I started [CS50x Miami](http://theideacenter.co/cs50xmiami/) at the Idea Center. CS50 is the Introduction to Computer Science course from Harvard, now offered in different learning institutions around the country as CS50x (sort of like what TEDx does for TED). This is probably the first course you should take if you're interested in learning how to program, as it teaches you how to think like the computer and how to understand the basic constructs you will find in any programming language. In my case I'm taking this course kind of late into my web development journey, but better late than never to make sure I'm not missing anything important.

I am also exploring the movement toward the [decentralized web](https://dci.mit.edu/decentralizedweb) by trying out [Secure Scuttlebutt](https://scuttlebutt.nz), a peer-to-peer social network that uses no centralized server and can be read off-line (content resides in your local computer), and experimenting with the [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com) and the [DAT](https://datproject.org) data sharing protocol. 

My current interest in the decentralized web comes from the fact that the web has been [cornered by a few big players](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a15895746/bust-big-tech-silicon-valley/?src=nl&mag=esq&list=nl_enl_news&date=020818), which rely on surveillance and addiction-inducing algorithms to make money at the expense of their users. I think that learning about tools that strive to bringing the web back to its original, decentralized state is a way to fight back against those bad actors.

Perhaps not surprisingly, I am currently reading [Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now](http://www.jaronlanier.com/tenarguments.html) by Jaron Lanier.
