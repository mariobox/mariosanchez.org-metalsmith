As content creators in the digital age, writers and journalists need to get familiar with data visualization tools. One of these tools is Juxtapose, created by [Northwestern University Knight Lab](http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/) using JavaScript.  

Juxtapose lets you highlight the *before-and-after* aspect of your stories using a visually compelling slider graphic (you can [make one on the app's website](https://juxtapose.knightlab.com/) and then just cut and embed a snippet of code on your site).

I tried it myself using two selfies I took during the last World Cup, wearing the jerseys of the two finalists (lame example, I know, but think of the possibilities if you're covering a more serious subject!)

If you want to check out the Juxtapose source code it is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/juxtapose).

Update: Here is a [great example of Juxtapose](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/07/amazing-photos-capture-1910-great-flood-of-paris-v-2016/) used in news media.
