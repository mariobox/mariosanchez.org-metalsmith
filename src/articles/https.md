I recently configured my web server to serve this site over HTTPS. 

HTTPS, or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and a website. The 'S' at the end of HTTPS stands for 'Secure'. This means all communications between your browser and a website are encrypted. (Learn [why you should use HTTPS instead of plain HTTP](https://www.eff.org/encrypt-the-web)). 
  
To enable HTTPS on my site I used [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/about/), an automatic tool that fetches and deploys a [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) certificate on your webserver. 
  
The certificate deployed by Certbot is issued by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), a free, automated, and open [certificate authority (CA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority), run for the publicâ€™s benefit. Let's Encrypt is a joint project by the [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://www.eff.org), [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org) and many other sponsors.
  
Since I am running a [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/b96aa4f9fdfd) (aff. link) Nginx server on Ubuntu 16.04, I followed [this tutorial to install the Let's Encrypt certificate on my server](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-let-s-encrypt-with-nginx-server-blocks-on-ubuntu-16-04).
  
If you decide to use Let's Encrypt on your site too, please consider sending them a [donation](https://letsencrypt.org/donate/). Your contribution will support those who are working to create a more secure and privacy-respecting web.
