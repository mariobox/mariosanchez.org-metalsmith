New year, new site...

After almost two years using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io), I've decided to switch my static site generator to [Metalsmith](http://Metalsmith.io). If you are reading this post, you are already looking at the Metalsmith-generated site.

I have only good things to say about Hugo, so my decision has nothing to do with it. The reason I decided to switch is that I want to learn more about JavaScript, and I figured that using a JavaScript-based site generator like Metalsmith will help me move closer to my goal.

To do the switch, I started with a [barebones Metalsmith setup](../how-to-create-an-minimal-metalsmith-blog/) that I then tweaked until it resembled my old Hugo site. That involved modifying the templates, incorporating the style sheets, and moving over graphic assets and posts.

Along the whole process, I relied heavily on this [extremely helpful tutorial](https://www.neustadt.fr/essays/crafting-a-simple-blog-with-metalsmith/), which does a great job of explaining each and every step to get a basic Metalsmith blog up and running quickly and reliably.

As I experiment with adding new features and plug-ins to my initial setup, I look forward to learning many new and interesting things about JavaScript.
