A few weeks ago, the company moved us to a new office. When we walked into our shiny, new cubicles we found a single sheet of paper laid out on top of our recently installed, empty desks describing something called "The 6S Discipline". 

It was a concise list of 6 bullet points that summarized a process to keep our work stations clean and organized. I later found out that the 6S concept comes from the [Lean Manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) philosophy, the principles of which can also be applied to an office setting.

Since I have always liked to keep my workplace neatly organized and keep around only the things I need at one particular moment, the 6S concept strongly resonated with me. 

If you want to learn more about the 6S philosophy, you can read this [comprehensive 6S overview](https://www.vitalentusa.com/learn/An_Introduction_to_6S.pdf) I found searching online. On the other hand, if you just want to grasp the gist of it, here are the 6S principles in short form, just like in the page I found on my desk:

### Sort ###
* Sort out necessary and unnecessary items
* Keep only items necessary to perform the job
* Remove and discard the items not required

### Set In Order ###
* Organize the essential materials in the workplace
* Find "a place for everything and keep everything in its place"

### Shine ###
* Keep the area clean at all times

### Standardize ###
* Maintain the Sort, Set In Order, and Shine Steps

### Sustain ###
* Maintain the gain
* Look for ways to continuously improve your work area

### Safety First ###
* Provide an accident-free workplace. Eliminate hazards.

In essence, 6S is about <mark>eliminating waste and maximizing value-adding activities</mark>, by creating and maintaining an organized, clean, safe and efficient work environment.
