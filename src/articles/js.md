These past two weeks I've been learning JavaScript, so I decided to put the theory into practice by doing the exercises in [The Odin Project JavaScript and jQuery chapter](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript-and-jquery).

## Restaurant Page

Create a basic three page website, with a tabbed navigation menu. Each time you hit a tab, you must be directed to the content implied by that tab, but without loading a new page. The idea is to use jQuery to change the page content, leaving the other elements (header, nav and footer) intact.

## Max Number in Array

Prompt the user to enter several numbers. Create a JavaScript program that calculates the maximum number provided by the user and prints it to the page.

## Vowel Count

Prompt the user to enter a phrase and create a JavaScript program that calculates the number of times each vowel appears in the phrase, and prints the results to the page.

## Invert the Phrase

Prompt the user to enter a phrase and create a JavaScript program that prints the phrase to the page, but spelled backwards.

## Basic Calculator

Using HTML, CSS, JS and jQuery, build a basic calculator that adds, subtracts, multiplies and divides. It must also have a Clear button.
