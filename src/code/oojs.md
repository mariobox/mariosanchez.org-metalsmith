This is a practice project that takes a series of soccer games (team A vs. team B) and lets you click on the team you think is going to win. You can also click on an "X" for tie. Once you do that, the team standings table will update automatically. It follows the standard punctuation of competitive soccer games: three points for the winner, zero for the loser, and one point for each team if there is a tie.

This project was done using pure JavaScript.

You can adapt the program to different teams and number of games.
