**Made with**: <i class="icon-reactjs"></i> ReactJS

**Project Summary**:

Gallery of tiles displaying information about different cars. Includes button to load more cars, and a form to add new cars to the gallery.

At its initial state, the app displays four cards for four different cars. If you click on the "Load More" button, it will display four more cards. There is also a brief form where users can add new cars to the gallery.

The main topics and techniques that I learned or practiced through this project are:

* How to use the <code>create-react-app</code>. This app simplifies your ReactJS development process by providing all the scaffolding necessary to start coding right away. It even gives you the option to fire up a development server that refreshes automatically every time you make and save a change.
* Practice ES6 concepts like classes, arrow functions and modules.
* Learn about JSX, a preprocessor step that adds XML syntax to JavaScript. JSX works basically like HTML but lets you create your own elements.
* Understand the concept of state. You can think of state as a single JavaScript object which represents all the data in your app at any given time.
* How to work with props (properties) and <code>this</code>.
* How to work with components and the import and export syntax in order to link different ReactJS files to make them work together.
* Understand the difference between the development and the production environments.

**Note**: For this project I followed this [ReactJS tutorial](https://code.tutsplus.com/series/react-crash-course-for-beginners--cms-1204) as a guide. It has a more detailed explanation of each step if you want to take a look or try it out yourself.
