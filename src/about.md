Hi, I'm **Mario Sanchez Carrion**. I am a junior web developer and programmer based in Miami. I currently work full time as a marketing manager for a Fortune 500 industrial and consumer goods manufacturer, but web development and coding is my passion and what I spend my time learning when I'm not at work. This is a personal site I put together to keep track of what I learn. 

## Why Code?

Some people like to run marathons, others like to do yoga, others like to do gardening. I like to code.

I have always been fascinated by the Internet, and have been an active participant on the web since the mid-to-late 90's. My first website was a painstakingly hand-coded [Geocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities) site built using the first iterations of HTML and CSS. Later, I built and ran other sites using those same tools.

Then Web 2.0 came along, and I started experimenting with a few self-hosted Wordpress blogs. After a while, however, the blogging ecosystem lost steam as social networks like Facebook, Twitter and others captured most of the web's traffic. Now, of course, we all know that social networks are for the most part [toxic, addiction-forming platforms](https://www.ted.com/talks/jaron_lanier_how_we_need_to_remake_the_internet). Some time ago, I deleted my Facebook account and stopped using Twitter. I am still using Whatsapp with a very selective group of people.

I am currently focused on learning the languages and tools of modern web development, having developed websites and programs using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, NodeJS, and ReactJS. I have also created sites using [static site generators](https://staticsitegenerators.net/) like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io) (the engine I'm currently using to build this site). Finally, I recently completed [CS50](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/), where I learned to build dynamic sites with Python, Flask and SQLite.

## How Did You Learn To Code?

I am mostly self-taught using freely available online resources. I also found the courses on [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/mariosanchezcarrion) very helpful and well worth the $25 a month subscription fee, especially if you're just starting. I have also completed the [WebDev](https://theideacenter.co/webdev/) and the [CS50xMiami](https://theideacenter.co/cs50xmiami/) programs at [The Idea Center](https://theideacenter.co/webdev/). The [edX](https://edx.org) platform is also a great place to find courses that you can take for free and at your own pace.

## About This Site

The first thing you notice when you visit this site is how plain it looks. I think there is something refreshing in the simple aesthetics of early computer programming, so I decided to adopt the look and feel of a text-based terminal. 

To build the site I use a [static site generator](https://staticsitegenerators.net/) called [Metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io), made with NodeJS. When I want to update the site, I just write content in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) and then run Metalsmith to create the site's HTML files. Those files are then deployed to a [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com)-powered virtual private server.

This site is served on your browser using [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS), or Secure HTTP, courtesy of [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org), so all communications with this site are encrypted and secure. Also, this site doesn't track you, nor does it use any third party tracking tools. There are no Google Analytics and no social media share buttons installed. 

The site's [source code](https://github.com/mariobox/mariosanchez.org) is open-source and hosted on Github. In the spirit of sharing feel free to use the style sheets and templates for your own site if you want (just add your own content).
