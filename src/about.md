My name is **Mario Sanchez Carrion**. I am a marketing professional and junior web developer living in Miami, FL. 

I am originally from Peru, where I graduated as an Industrial Engineer prior to coming to the United States for an MBA, and spending the next 20+ years in [marketing and product management](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariobox/).
