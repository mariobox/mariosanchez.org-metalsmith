Hi, I'm **Mario Sanchez Carrion**. I currently work full time as a product development manager for a large industrial and consumer goods manufacturer, but I also pursue web development and programming as a serious hobby. This is a personal site I put together to keep track of what I learn. 

## Why Code?

After 20+ years working in marketing and commercial roles I noticed that I am still an engineer at heart, and that I very much enjoy coding and tinkering with computers. I started taking up coding more seriously a couple of years ago, learning something new every day and making coding practice the main activity during most of my free time [[update](/now/)].

## How Did You Learn To Code?

I am mostly self-taught using freely available online resources. I also found the courses at [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/mariosanchezcarrion) very helpful and well worth the $25 a month subscription fee, especially if you're just starting. I have also completed the [WebDev](https://theideacenter.co/webdev/) and the [CS50xMiami](https://theideacenter.co/cs50xmiami/) programs at [The Idea Center](https://theideacenter.co/webdev/). The [edX](https://edx.org) platform is also a great place to find courses that you can take for free and at your own pace.

## About This Site

This site is built with a [static site generator](https://staticsitegenerators.net/) called [Metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io), made with NodeJS. 

When I want to update the site, I just write content in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) and then run Metalsmith to create the site's HTML files. Those files are then deployed to a [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com)  virtual private server. The site's files are version-controlled with Git and hosted in a [Github]((https://github.com/mariobox/mariosanchez.org)) remote repository.

This site is served on your browser using [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS), or Secure HTTP, thanks to [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org). That means that all communications with this site are encrypted and secure. Also, this site doesn't track you, nor does it use any third party tracking tools. There are no Google Analytics and no social media share buttons installed. 

The site's [source code](https://github.com/mariobox/mariosanchez.org) is open-source and hosted in Github. In the spirit of sharing feel free to use the style sheets and templates for your own site if you want (just add your own content).

## What Else?

I usually travel several times a year for work and pleasure and attend coding classes or meetups whenever I can. Here are some [pictures](/snapshots/) of places I've been. I also keep a [now](/now) page, inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about).
