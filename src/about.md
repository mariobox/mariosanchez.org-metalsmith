Hi, I'm **Mario Sanchez Carrion**. I am a brand strategist and junior web developer based in Miami. I currently work full time as a marketing manager in the consumer goods industry, but web development and coding is my focus when I'm not at work. This is my web development personal site. 

I have always been fascinated by the Internet, and have been an active participant on the web since the mid-to-late 90's. My first website was a painstakingly hand-coded [Geocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities) site built using the first iterations of HTML and CSS. Later, I built and ran other sites using those same tools, with the main purpose of learning about search engine optimization (SEO).

When Web 2.0 came along, I self-hosted a few Wordpress blogs, which lost steam once social networks like Twitter and Facebook became more popular. Now, of course, we all know that Facebook, Twitter and the like are [toxic, addiction-inducing platforms](https://www.ted.com/talks/jaron_lanier_how_we_need_to_remake_the_internet) that manipulate and exploit their users for money. This year I finally deleted my Facebook account and logged out of Twitter for good, only to re-discover the joy of building and deploying my own site from scratch. After all, you don't need a large, centralized platform to express yourself online: all you neeed is a domain name, a few HTML files, and a place to host them.

I believe that the best way to create a simple site these days is by using a [static site generator](https://staticsitegenerators.net/). A static site generator is basically a small program written in languages like JavaScript, Ruby, Go, Python, and others, that takes content files written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and transforms them into a website made only of HTML and CSS files that you can then deploy to the open web.  So far, I've experimented with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io) (the engine I am currently using to build this site). 

## About This Site

The first thing you will notice about this site is how plain it looks. That's exactly how I want it. I want to keep it [minimalist](../mini), functional and fast. I could make it more fancy, but that's not what I want for my personal site. This site is also responsive, so it will look good both in laptops and mobile devices.

When I want to update the site, I write content in Markdown and then run Metalsmith to create the site's HTML files. Those files are then deployed to a [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com)-powered virtual private server that uses a [Nginx](https://nginx.org) web server.

This site is transmitted through [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS), or Secure HTTP, courtesy of [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org), so all communications with this site are encrypted and secure. Also, this site doesn't track you, nor does it use any third party tracking tools. There are no Google Analytics and no social media share buttons installed. 

The site's [source code](https://github.com/mariobox/mariosanchez.org) is open-source and hosted in Github. In the spirit of sharing you can use the style sheet and layouts on your own site if you want (just add your own content).
