My name is **Mario Sanchez Carrion**. I am a marketing professional and junior web developer living in Miami, FL. 

I am originally from Peru, where I graduated as an Industrial Engineer prior to coming to the United States for an MBA, and spending the next 20+ years in [marketing and product management](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariobox/).

I've completed the WebDev program at [The Idea Center](http://theideacenter.co ) and the [Front-End Web Development Track](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/front-end-web-development) at Treehouse.
