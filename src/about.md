My name is **Mario Sanchez Carrion**. I am a marketing professional and junior web developer living in Miami, FL. 

I am originally from Peru, where I graduated as an Industrial Engineer prior to getting an MBA in the US, and spending the next 20+ years in [marketing and product management](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariobox/).

While I spend most of my time as a brand manager for a Fortune 500 consumer goods company, my new area of focus is [web development](../skills). 

I am self-taught, mainly through courses taken in [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/mariosanchezcarrion), as well as other online platforms like Coursera, Codecademy and Codeschool. I've also completed the WebDev program at [The Idea Center](http://theideacenter.co ). You can visit my [Github profile](https://github.com/mariobox) to take a look at the exercises and practice projects I've completed.

My goal in web development is to learn something new every day and to put it to practice.

These are my [web development skills](../skills) so far.
