My name is **Mario Sanchez Carrion**. I am a marketing professional and web developer in training living in Miami, FL. I am originally from Peru, where I graduated as an Industrial Engineer prior to coming to the United States for an MBA, and spending the next 20+ years in marketing and product management.

I am currently studying to become a front end web developer and use this site to practice what I learn.
