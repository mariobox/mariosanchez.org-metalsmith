Hi, I'm **Mario Sanchez Carrion**. I am a Miami-based junior web developer and programmer. This is a personal site I put together to keep track of what I learn. 

## Why Code?

Even though for the last 20+ years I've been working in marketing and commercial roles I am still an engineer at heart. I love coding and tinkering with computers. I started to take coding more seriously a few years ago, trying to learn something new every day and making a habit out of daily coding practice.

## How Did You Learn To Code?

I am mostly self-taught through freely available online resources. I also found the courses at [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/mariosanchezcarrion) very helpful and well worth the $25 a month subscription fee, especially if you're just starting. I have also completed the [WebDev](https://theideacenter.co/webdev/) and the [CS50xMiami](https://theideacenter.co/cs50xmiami/) programs at [The Idea Center](https://theideacenter.co/webdev/). The [edX](https://edx.org) platform is also a great place to find courses that you can take for free and at your own pace. Once you get some of the basics straight and there's something you need to do, just Google it and you will find tutorials for practically anything you would want.

## About This Site

This site is built with a Node-based [static site generator](https://staticsitegenerators.net/) called [Metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io). Static site generator is just a fancy name for a program that takes a bunch of templates and content you have written, and spits out a static website made of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. 

When I want to update the site, I just write content in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) and then run Metalsmith. Then I take the static files that Metalsmith has generated and [deploy](/vps/) them to a [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) virtual private server (VPS). There are easier ways to host your site, like on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), but I went the VPS route to learn how to do it.

The site's files are version-controlled with [Git](/gcs/) and hosted in a [Github]((https://github.com/mariobox/mariosanchez.org)) remote repository.

This site is served to your browser using [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS), or Secure HTTP, thanks to [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org). If you look at your browser address bar, you will probably see a green lock symbol next to my domain name. That means that all communications with this site are encrypted and secure. 

I don't use Google Analytics or any social media Like buttons that spy for big tech companies, so when you use this site you can rest assured that you're not being tracked. 

The site's [source code](https://github.com/mariobox/mariosanchez.org) is open-source and hosted in Github. In the spirit of sharing feel free to use the style sheets and templates for your own site if you want (just add your own content).

This is the <a href="/stack/">stack</a> I'm currently running.
