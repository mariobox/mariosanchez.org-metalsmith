Hi, I'm **Mario Sanchez Carrion**. I am a junior web developer and programmer based in Miami. I currently work full time as a marketing manager for a Fortune 500 industrial and consumer goods manufacturer, but web development and coding is my focus when I'm not at work. This is a personal site I put together to keep track of my coding progress. 

I have always been fascinated by the Internet, and have been an active participant on the web since the mid-to-late 90's. My first website was a painstakingly hand-coded [Geocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities) site built using the first iterations of HTML and CSS. Later, I built and ran other sites using those same tools.

Then Web 2.0 came along, and I started experimenting with a few self-hosted Wordpress blogs. After a while, however, the blogging ecosystem lost steam as social networks like Twitter and Facebook became more popular. Now, of course, we all know that Facebook, Twitter and others are [toxic, addiction-inducing platforms](https://www.ted.com/talks/jaron_lanier_how_we_need_to_remake_the_internet) that manipulate and exploit their users. 

This year I finally deleted my Facebook account and logged out of Twitter for good, only to re-discover the joy of building and deploying websites from scratch. 

I am currently focused on learning the languages and tools of modern web development, and have developed websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, NodeJS, and ReactJS. I have also created sites using [static site generators](https://staticsitegenerators.net/) like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io) (the engine I'm currently using to build this site). I am now practicing building dynamic sites with Python, Flask and SQLite.

I am mostly self-taught using freely available online resources. I also found the courses on [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/mariosanchezcarrion) very helpful and well worth the $25 a month subscription fee. I have also completed the [WebDev](https://theideacenter.co/webdev/) program at [The Idea Center](https://theideacenter.co/webdev/), where I am currently enrolled in [CS50xMiami](https://theideacenter.co/cs50xmiami/).

## About This Site

The first thing you will notice about this site is how plain it looks. I didn't want anything facy, just something [minimalist](../mini), functional and fast. 

To build this site I used a [static site generator](https://staticsitegenerators.net/) called [Metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io), made with NodeJS. When I want to update the site, I just write content in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) and then run Metalsmith to create the site's HTML files. Those files are then deployed to a [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com)-powered virtual private server.

This site is served to your browser using [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS), or Secure HTTP, courtesy of [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org), so all communications with this site are encrypted and secure. Also, this site doesn't track you, nor does it use any third party tracking tools. There are no Google Analytics and no social media share buttons installed. 

The site's [source code](https://github.com/mariobox/mariosanchez.org) is open-source and hosted on Github. In the spirit of sharing feel free to use the style sheets and templates for your own site if you want (just add your own content).
