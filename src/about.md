Hi, I'm **Mario Sanchez Carrion**. I am a web developer and programmer in training based in Miami. I currently work full time as a marketing manager and brand strategist at a Fortune 500 industrial and consumer goods manufacturer, but web development and coding is what I do on my spare time. This is my web development personal site. 

I have always been fascinated by the Internet, and have been an active participant on the web since the mid-to-late 90's. My first website was a painstakingly hand-coded [Geocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities) site built using the first iterations of HTML and CSS. Later, I built and ran other sites using those same tools.

When Web 2.0 came along, I self-hosted a few Wordpress blogs, but after a few years the blogging ecosystem lost steam as social networks like Twitter and Facebook became more popular. Now, of course, we all know that Facebook, Twitter and the like are [toxic, addictive platforms](https://www.ted.com/talks/jaron_lanier_how_we_need_to_remake_the_internet) that manipulate and exploit users for money. 

This year I finally deleted my Facebook account and logged out of Twitter for good, only to re-discover the joy of building and deploying websites from scratch. After all, you don't need a large, centralized platform to give you permission to express yourself online: all you need is a domain name, a few HTML files, a place to host them, and the willingness to acquire the necessary skills.

I am currently focused on learning the languages and tools of modern web development, and have developed websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, NodeJS, and ReactJS. I have also created sites using [static site generators](https://staticsitegenerators.net/) like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io) (the engine I'm currently using to build this site).

I am mostly self-taught using freely available online resources. I also found the courses on [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/mariosanchezcarrion) very helpful and well worth the $25 a month subscription fee. I have also completed the [WebDev](https://theideacenter.co/webdev/) program at [The Idea Center](https://theideacenter.co/webdev/), where I am currently enrolled in [CS50xMiami](https://theideacenter.co/cs50xmiami/).

## About This Site

The first thing you will notice about this site is how plain it looks. That's exactly how I want it. I want to keep it [minimalist](../mini), functional and fast. 

To build this site I used a [static site generator](https://staticsitegenerators.net/) called [Metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io), made with NodeJS. When I want to update the site, I just write content in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) and then run Metalsmith to create the site's HTML files. Those files are then deployed to a [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com)-powered virtual private server.

This site is served to your browser using [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS), or Secure HTTP, courtesy of [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org), so all communications with this site are encrypted and secure. Also, this site doesn't track you, nor does it use any third party tracking tools. There are no Google Analytics and no social media share buttons installed. 

The site's [source code](https://github.com/mariobox/mariosanchez.org) is open-source and hosted on Github. In the spirit of sharing feel free to use the style sheets and templates for your own site if you want (just add your own content).
