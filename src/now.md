These days I spend my week days at my [full time job](http://linkedin.com/in/mariobox), and most of my nights and weekends practicing front-end web development and coding.

I recently completed the WebDev program at [The Idea Center](http://theideacenter.co), and the [Front End Web Development track](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/front-end-web-development) at [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com).  Right now I'm in  practice mode and trying some other online courses.

Also, at any given point I am always reading a book. I am currently reading [The Startup of You](http://www.thestartupofyou.com/) by Reid Hoffman and Ben Casnocha.

Other than that, I follow a daily morning stretching and strengthening routine as soon as I wake up, and try not to miss any game of my favorite soccer team: Argentina's [River Plate](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mariobox/4447672631/in/album-72157623657717740/).
