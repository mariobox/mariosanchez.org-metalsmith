Coding and web development are my main activities when I'm not at work. I do it with [no expectation](https://sivers.org/balance) of employment or reward, just personal enjoyment. These days I am mostly practicing ReactJS and NodeJS while brushing up on basic web development concepts and fine tuning this site. I'm always open to talk coding by email, as long as you're not trying to sell me something.

#### Reading

I'm currently reading [The World Beyond Your Head](https://amzn.to/37Ma1Zn) by Matthew B. Crawford. The book deals with how to cope with the multiple demands for our attention in the modern world.
