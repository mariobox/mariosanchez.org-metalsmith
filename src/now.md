From Monday through Friday I work as a brand marketing manager for a large hardware manufacturer. On nights and weekends I spend most of the time teaching myself how to code, and reading good non-fiction books.

To help me in my coding journey I'm using [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com), which I have found immensely helpful and I would recommend to anybody who wants to get started in web development and programming. I have also taken courses in [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/), [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and other online resources.

My current focus is on publishing online using static site generators, and deploying sites on Virtual Private Servers.

I'm currently reading <a href="https://dci.mit.edu/decentralizedweb">The Decentralized Web. A report by the MIT Digital Currency Initiative and the Center for Civic Media</a>, and will pick up Principles, by Ray Dalio, next.
