These days I am spending most of my nights and weekends learning front end web development and coding.

I am enrolled in the WebDev program at [The Idea Center](http://theideacenter.co), and I'm also using several online platforms to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In the last few days I've pushed a few homework projects to Github repositories, and managed to switch this site from [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) to [Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io).

Other than that, I keep a daily morning stretching and strengthening routine, and try to watch every game of my favorite soccer team: Argentina's River Plate.
