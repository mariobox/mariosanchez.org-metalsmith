These days I spend Monday through Friday at my [full time job](http://linkedin.com/in/mariobox), and most of my nights and weekends learning and practicing web development and programming.

I recently completed the WebDev program at [The Idea Center](http://theideacenter.co), and the [Front End Web Development track](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/front-end-web-development) at [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com).  I'm currently learning Node and Express.

I'm usually reading something, although lately I've been focused 100% on coding. Two books I recently read and recommend are [Ego is the Enemy](../ego) and [Mindset](http://amzn.to/2sJBYwo).

Other than that, I follow a daily morning stretching and strengthening routine complemented by gym sessions on weekends, and try not to miss any game of my favorite soccer team: Argentina's [River Plate](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mariobox/4447672631/in/album-72157623657717740/).
