These days I spend my week days at my [full time job](http://linkedin.com/in/mariobox), and most of my nights and weekends practicing front-end web development and coding.

I recently completed the WebDev program at [The Idea Center](http://theideacenter.co), and the [Front End Web Development track](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/front-end-web-development) at [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com).  Right now I'm in learning Object Oriented JavaScript using the tutorials at [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).

Other than those two main activities, I follow a daily morning stretching and strengthening routine as soon as I wake up, and try not to miss any game of my favorite soccer team: Argentina's [River Plate](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mariobox/4447672631/in/album-72157623657717740/).
