These days I spend my week days at my [full time job](http://linkedin.com/in/mariobox), and most of my nights and weekends practicing front-end web development and coding.

I recently completed the WebDev program at [The Idea Center](http://theideacenter.co), so I'm now in full practice mode and expanding my web development knowledge through different online platforms.

In the last few days I've pushed a few homework projects to [Github repositories](https://github.com/mariobox), and managed to switch this site [from Hugo to Metalsmith](../metalswitch/).

Also, at any given point I am always reading a book. I am currently reading (actually, re-reading) [So Good They Can't Ignore You](http://calnewport.com/books/so-good/) by Cal Newport.

Other than that, I follow a daily morning stretching and strengthening routine as soon as I wake up, and try not to miss any game of my favorite soccer team: Argentina's [River Plate](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mariobox/4447672631/in/album-72157623657717740/).
