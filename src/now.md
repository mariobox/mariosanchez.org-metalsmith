These days I spend Monday through Friday at my [full time job](http://linkedin.com/in/mariobox), and most of my nights and weekends teaching  myself how to code, and reading good non-fiction books.

To help me in my coding journey I enrolled in [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com), which I have found immensely helpful. 

My current focus is learning JavaScript in depth. I am currently focusing on ReactJS.

Due to my focus on coding I am not reading that much these days. I'm planning on picking up Principles, by Ray Dalio, as soon as I find some time.
