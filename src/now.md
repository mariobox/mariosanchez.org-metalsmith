From Monday through Friday I work as a brand marketing manager for a large hardware manufacturer. On nights and weekends I spend most of the time teaching  myself how to code, and reading good non-fiction books.

To help me in my coding journey I enrolled in [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com), which I have found immensely helpful and I would recommend to anybody who wants to get started in web development and programming. I have also taken courses in [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/), [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and other online resources.

My current focus is on learning JavaScript in depth. Right now I am learning ReactJS.

Due to my focus on coding I am not reading that much these days. I'm planning on picking up Principles, by Ray Dalio, as soon as I find some time.
