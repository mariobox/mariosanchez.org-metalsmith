I named 2018 The Year of Coding. On December 14 I concluded [CS50x Miami](http://theideacenter.co/cs50xmiami/). CS50 is the Introduction to Computer Science course from Harvard, a five-month course where you can learn the fundamentals of web development and programming, including C, Python, and JavaScript.

I am now taking a break from programming and focusing on learning how to operate a Virtual Private Server and getting familiar with Linux commands. 

Aside from that, I've named 2019 The Year of Personal Finance. I am tending to my portfolio of stocks focusing mainly on value, dividend-paying securities. My aim is to beat the S&P500 at the end of the year.
