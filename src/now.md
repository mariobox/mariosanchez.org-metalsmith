I am currently working for a power tools manufacturer as an international product marketing manager. While I'm not at work I'm usually coding and learning web development. 

These days I am mostly practicing React and Nodejs while brushing up on basic web development concepts. I'm passionate about coding and web development and I'm pursuing them with [no expectation](https://sivers.org/balance) of employment or reward, just personal enjoyment. I'm always open to talk coding by email, as long as you're not trying to sell me something.
