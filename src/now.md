These days I spend my week days at my [full time job](http://linkedin.com/in/mariobox), and most of my nights and weekends learning front-end web development and coding.

I am enrolled in the WebDev program at [The Idea Center](http://theideacenter.co), and I'm also using several online platforms to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In the last few days I've pushed a few homework projects to [Github repositories](https://github.com/mariobox), and managed to switch this site [from Hugo to Metalsmith](../metalswitch/).

Other than that, I follow a daily morning stretching and strengthening routine as soon as I wake up, and try not to miss any game of my favorite soccer team: Argentina's [River Plate](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mariobox/4447672631/in/album-72157623657717740/).
